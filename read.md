# REST API using Express.js and MongoDB

# REST API 
 Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services

# Resources
In REST, everything is considered a resource. These resources can be objects, data, or services that are identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

# HTTP Method
RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in REST are

GET: Retrieve a resource.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
DELETE: Remove a resource.

# Uniform Interface
Resource identification through URIs.
Resource manipulation through representations.
Self-descriptive messages.
Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS), allowing the API to guide the client through available actions.
